## Conclusion and Recommendations

In conclusion, some of the ways to get a higher IMDB score is to include English language into the film, premier the film in June and create a film with a genre in the top 5 (Concert Film, Making-of, One-man show, Animation / Short and War drama).

Although there might not be significant ways to improve the IMDB score, films created this way is more likely to achieve a higher average score. 

Further improvements:
- Include more features such as Film budget, Film viewership and cast. 
- Create Tableau dashboard to check out scores of film in different genres, year, month etc.
